Description: OpenGL function pointer management library
 It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
 eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little
 knowledge needed on their part.  They get to read GL specs and write
 code using undecorated function names like glCompileShader().
